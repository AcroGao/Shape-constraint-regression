# Shape-constraint-regression
The shape constraint regression is applied to given paired data (y, t) and the regression model is "y = g(t)",where "g" is the unknown linked function. 
The estimation and design of shape constraint are based on B-spline expansion. 
Sovling a quadratic loss function with penalization term, the shape constraint estimator is got. 
The strength of penalization is determined by Covaraince Information Criterion. 
For the selection of tunning parameters, a grid search process is introduced.

Please also check the publication "Automatic shape-constraint non-parametric regression" for the theoretic properties and application.
